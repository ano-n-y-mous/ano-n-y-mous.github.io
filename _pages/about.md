I am a second-year PhD student at the School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCSE) of Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. My scholarship is under SINGA by Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R) of Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR).

I work on video understanding & machine learning by using multi modalities under the supervision of [Prof. Joo Hwee Lim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BjEDX4EAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr Zhu Hongyuan](https://hongyuanzhu.github.io/) from A*STAR and [Prof. Xavier Bresson](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/xbresson/index.html) from NTU.
