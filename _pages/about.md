I am a second-year PhD student at the School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCSE) of Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. My scholarship is under Singapore International Graduate Award (SINGA) by Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R) of Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR).

I work on **video understanding & machine learning** by using **multi modalities** under the supervision of [Prof. Joo Hwee Lim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BjEDX4EAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr Zhu Hongyuan](https://hongyuanzhu.github.io/) from A*STAR and [Prof. Hanwang Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/hanwangzhang) from NTU.
