I am a second-year PhD student at NTU, Singapore. My scholarship is under SINGA by A*STAR.

I work on **video understanding & machine learning** by using **multi modalities** under the supervision of [Prof. Joo Hwee Lim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BjEDX4EAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr Zhu Hongyuan](https://hongyuanzhu.github.io/) from A*STAR and [Prof. Hanwang Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/hanwangzhang) from NTU.

I did my master under the supervision of [Prof. Ahmet Emir Dirik](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cfgcBIEAAAAJ&hl=tr) on vehicle detection. I also have various working experiences, from a start-up in Istanbul to Turkish Airlines Technology.
